          I've always had an interest in film making.
          My love for editing comes from my passion for upcoming software.
          While spending time dabling through these softwares,
          I often wondered what it would be like to work on a hollywood production.
          The first oppurtunity was through school, when they asked a friend
          and I to create the Farewell video for our graduating seniors. Excited,
          we put almost 20 hours into editing it. The final product can be seen below.

          Much positive feedback was gathered when we featured this film in front of the school.
          It was great to see our seniors leave school one last time, with a smile on their faces.
          From then on, we were known as the film guys in the foyer. School provided us with more projects
          to work on such as the Republic Day Film and Behind the Scenes for our School production.
          Our school conducts a model united nation called "The International Youth Conference" every year.
          As a part of the organizing committee, both of us were given the roles of "Videography Heads".
          We were responsible for the filming and editing of 7 different trailers and multiple crisis videos for the UN committees.
          It was a long process, almost like a mini-production. From discussing a script with the committee heads,
          finding a location, gear to be used, music selection and editing with the group. With almost a 100+ hours
          put into this project, both of us were really proud of our outcome. The youtube channel and a video
          have been shown below.
